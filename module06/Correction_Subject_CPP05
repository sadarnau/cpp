CPP Module 06
Scalar conversion Is the program running as intended, and did the student use the
static_cast to convert values? We'll accept the use of implicit casts for
promotion casts only.

Anyway, please don't be too uncompromising
towards the exercice's outputs if the spirit of the exercice is respected.
Failing this exercice does not prevent from grading the next ones. I know this exercice
can be cryptic to some students.

Retyping of raw data Is the program running as intended, and did the student use the
reinterpret_cast to retype the raw data?
Remember that the raw data pointed to by the void * must be 52 bytes (24+4+24) contiguous on the heap.

Real type identification Is the program running as intended, and did the student use the
dynamic_casts to identify the real type?
(In case you're wondering, the header <typeinfo> must not appear anywhere.)
